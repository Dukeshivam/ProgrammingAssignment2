# get_inv() first checks if inv_sam is NULL. If it is, it computes the inverse using solve(sam) and stores it in inv_sam.
# The return value is a list containing the set and get_inv functions, enabling object-like ("pointer-like") access to the underlying matrix and its inverse cache.

# x$getInverse() acts like dereferencing a pointer to a cached inverse. If the "pointer" already holds the computed inverse (not NULL), it is returned immediately with a message (no recalculation needed).
# If the pointer is NULL (no cached data), x$get() dereferences the matrix object to obtain the underlying matrix value.
# solve(mat, ...) computes the matrix inverse (an expensive operation), producing a new object.
# x$setInverse(j) "repoints" the inverseâ€™s pointer in the object to this newly computed inverse, updating the cache.
# Finally, the function returns the inverse pointer's value so that future calls use this cached result.
